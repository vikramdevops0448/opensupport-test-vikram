Steps to Set Up Multiple Environments with Terraform
We'll break the task into:

1. Terraform Setup.
2. Networking (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups).
3. EC2 Instances.
4. RDS (MySQL) Database.
5. S3 Bucket.
6. Multi-Environment Setup with Terraform Workspaces.
7. CI/CD Integration.

Project Structure:
   /terraform-project
  |-- main.tf
  |-- variables.tf
  |-- provider.tf

Multi-Environment Setup Using Terraform Workspaces:
 1. Initialize Terraform: First, initialize the Terraform configuration.
    cmd: terraform init
2. Create Workspaces:
    cmd: terraform workspace new development
         terraform workspace new staging
         terraform workspace new production
3. Select a Workspace:
    cmd: terraform workspace select development
4. Deploy to a Specific Environment:
      cmd: terraform plan -var environment=development
           terraform apply -var environment=development

Note: Each workspace maintains a separate state file, ensuring isolated infrastructure for each environment.
